    "## Introduction:\n",
    "In assignment 2, you will get familier with NetworkX (https://networkx.github.io/) for network analysis (creating network, reporting network statistics, calculating three node centrality measures, and implement two link prediction methods). NetworkX has nice documentation including all graph algorithms it supports: https://networkx.github.io/documentation/stable/reference/index.html\n",

    "## Dataset\n",

    "\n",
    "The whole network is a page-page graph of verified Facebook sites. Nodes represent official Facebook pages while the links are mutual likes between sites. Node features are extracted from the site descriptions that the page owners created to summarize the purpose of the site. This graph was collected through the Facebook Graph API in November 2017 and restricted to pages from 4 categories which are defined by Facebook. These categories are: politicians, governmental organizations, television shows and companies. \n",

    "## Important Note:\n",
    "Don't forget to provide a summary of your findings/results for Task 2-4.\n",
    "Submit your code (executed ipynb file) to onq."
